This directory contains some simple examples on how to use dccrg.

If you've installed the prerequisites into the default system
location or into your home directory you should be able to compile
the example by running make in this directory.

simple_game_of_life demonstrates the most basic usage of dccrg
and doesn't produce any output.

game_of_life shows how to overlap computation and communication
but is otherise quite close to the simple version.

game_of_life_with_output is the same as game_of_life but it also
saves the game into .dc files which can be converted to vtk
format with dc2vtk.

dc2vtk converts the .dc produced by game_of_life_with_output
into vtk files visualizable with VisIt
(https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit)
After running the game_of_life_with_output program you can view
the result with
./dc2vtk *.dc
and
visit -o game_of_life_000.vtk
