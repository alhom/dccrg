/*!
Defines the indices of a cell in the grid.

First value is the cell's index in x direction, second in the y direction, etc.
Indices start from 0 and the index of a cell is the one closest to the starting
corner of the grid within the cell.
Indices are of the same size as the smallest possible cell in the grid, e.g.
the size in indices of cells of maximum refinement level is 1.
For example in the following 2d grid the indices of cell 2 are (2, 0) and
cell 8 are (1, 1) assuming a maximum refinement level of 1.
\verbatim
--------->  x
|3|4|   |
|-|-| 2 |
|7|8|   |
|--------

/*!
Defines one item of cells' neighborhood in the grid.

Defines an offset (first value is offset in x direction, etc.)
of one neighbor to a cell of the same size as the cell itself.
A cell's neighborhood (e.g. stencil) in the grid consists of a
list of offsets that define which cells a cell considers as neighbors.
Offsets are given relative to the cell and cells within a volume
of equal size as the cell are considered the cell's neighbors.
For example in the case of the game of life in two dimensions (x and y),
neighborhood items making up the neighborhood would be:
\verbatim
-1, -1, 0
-1,  0, 0
-1, +1, 0
 0, -1, 0
 0, +1, 0
+1, -1, 0
+1,  0, 0
+1, +1, 0
\endverbatim
