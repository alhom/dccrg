dccrg is a header only library so installation consists of
putting the .hpp files in this directory somewhere where
your compiler can find them.

dccrg requires boost::mpi and Zoltan which might be available
from your distribution. If not you can compile them for
example into your home directory. Installation instructions
for several machines are given in
https://gitorious.org/dccrg/pages/Install
