This directory collects different tests developed for dccrg
and can be used to check that the installation of dccrg's
requirements was successful and also that dccrg itself works.

All of the tests should work with any number of processes, if
that's not the case please send at least the output of the
failing program(s) to one of the people listed in the
../CREDITS file.

Many test programs print additional help when run with the
--help command line option, for example listing additional
command line options.

You can use VisIt to visualize the test results:
https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit
See the ../examples/README file for basic VisIt instructions.

Each test directory has its own Makefile which assumes that
dccrg's requirements are installed into a default system
path or into your home directory. If that is not the case
modify the makefiles accordingly, most likely changing the
-I$$HOME/include -L$$HOME/lib items on the INCLUDE line to
something else should suffice. The makefiles use g++ for
compiling serial programs and mpic++ for parallel.

The most basic tests are in the game_of_life directory. The
advection and particles directories contain more advanced
tests and using them succesfully is a strong indication that
dccrg and its dependencies are installed correctly. Tests in
other directories check different parts of dccrg and also
serve as code examples.
