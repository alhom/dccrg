The basic tests of dccrg that play Conway's game of life.
See the ../README file for information common to all tests.

Running make test in this directory will test the basic
functionality of dccrg automatically by running the
most important tests using one and two MPI processes
with mpirun. If successful all automatic tests should
print PASSED to stdout.
The automatic test programs game_of_life_test_* and
unrefined2d_* also take command line arguments, run
them with the --help argument to see supported options.

The cell class in cell.hpp is an example of how to use /
support the different mechanisms available in dccrg for
sending cell data between processes. The Makefile shows
which preprocessor defines must be used for specific
functionality.
