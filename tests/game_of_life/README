The game of life tests of dccrg. See the ../README file
for information common to all tests.

Running make in this directory should produce around 20
executables. The game_of_life_* programs serve as a basic
test. Without additional arguments they should all print
Passed and return successfully after less than one minute.

The unrefined2d_* programs test basic adaptive mesh
refinement functionality of dccrg. Their correctness must
be examined by hand from the vtk files they produce when
given the --save command line option. One should see basic
Conway's Game of Life patterns moving through the grid or
staying still and the grid being adapted during the runs.

The cell class in cell.hpp is an example of how to use /
support the different mechanisms available in dccrg for
sending cell data between processes. The Makefile shows
which preprocessor defines must be used for specific
functionality.
