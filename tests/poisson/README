Tests for a solver of the Poisson equation implemented
on top of dccrg supporting a stretched grid, AMR, etc.
See the ../README file for information common to all tests.

Running make test in this directory will run the tests
using one MPI process with mpirun. Running make parallel-test
will run the tests using 6 MPI processes. If successful
all test print PASSED to stdout. Edit the Makefile to launch
the tests using another program interactively.
