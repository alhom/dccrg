Tests user defined neighborhoods of dccrg. See the ../README
file for information common to all tests.

The test programs game_of_life and neighbor_list_length are
automatic and print Passed to stdout if successful. They
must be run manually using for example mpirun and any
number of processes.

The advection test is otherwise similar to the one in
the ../advection directory but uses a default neighborhood
size that is much larger than necessary. A user defined
neighborhood is used to make a neighborhood that is
identical to the one used in ../advection. See the README
file in that directory for additional information and
a program to convert the results to vtk.
