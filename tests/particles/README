Particle propagation test of dccrg showing how to
store and use a variable amount of data in dccrg cells.
See the ../README file for information common to all tests.

simple_result.gif shows the expected result when visualized
with VisIt: Open (tests/particles/)simple_grid.visit and click
Add->Mesh->mesh, then open (tests/particles/)simple_particles.visit
and click Overlay. Click Add->Pseudocolor->cell and click
yes when VisIt asks about database correlation. Double-click
on Pseudocolor-cell and in Geometry tab change Point size
(pixels) to 20 and click Apply. Finally click draw and rotate
the view to match that in simple_result.gif.
