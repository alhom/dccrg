Tests the restart capability of dccrg. See the ../README file
for information common to all tests.

Restart files are written using the same functionality
as remote neighbor updates, i.e. the MPI datatype
returned by each local cell is used to write the
grid to a file using parallel I/O. The same applies to
loading the grid from a file.

Running make test will use Conway's game of life to
test saving and loading of the game using a serial program
and using mpirun with two processes. If successful each
test will print PASS to stdout.
