Tests the restart capability of dccrg. See the ../README file
for information common to all tests.

Restart files are written using the same functionality
as remote neighbor updates, i.e. the MPI datatype
returned by each local cell is used to write the
grid to a file using parallel I/O. The same applies to
loading the grid from a file. Currently the MPI
datatype of each cell is queried only once so
the amount of data per cell must be known before,
for example, any data is read from the file when loading.
At some point support for multiple rounds of file
I/O will be added so it will be possible to have
a variable amount of data in each cell.

Running make test will use Conway's game of life to
test saving and loading of the game using a serial program.
Running make parallel-test will test saving/loading using
mpirun with two processes. Edit the makefile to use
another program to launch the tests interactively.
If successful each test will print PASSED to stdout.
