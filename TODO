Add more documentation

Make dccrg even more modular:
-separate stateless logic (doesn't consider whether cells exist or not)
 into dccrg_index.hpp or similar with function names starting with get_.
-separate serial stateful logic into a separate file with function names
 starting with find_.
-separate parallel logic into a separate file.
-only put logic related to cell data into dccrg.hpp.

Allow users to preallocate their cells when updating
remote neighbor data, load balancing, etc. This way
default constructed user cells don't have to be able
to return correct MPI_Datatypes to dccrg.
