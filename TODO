Add more documentation

Use get_real_x,y,z in get_x,y,z_index_of_coord

Make dccrg even more modular:
-separate serial stateful logic into a separate file with function names
 starting with find_.
-separate parallel logic into a separate file.
-only put logic related to cell data into dccrg.hpp.

Allow users to preallocate their cells when updating
remote neighbor data, load balancing, etc. This way
default constructed user cells don't have to be able
to return correct MPI_Datatypes to dccrg.

Add support using standard C++ + MPI datatypes transparently, at least
once https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/9444 has been available
in a few release versions of boost.
